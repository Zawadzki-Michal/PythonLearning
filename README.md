This is my repo for my Python Development
#Python

#Variables:

1. Snake case
2. Start with lower case or underline
3. Letter, numbers, underscore
4. Case sensitive
5. Don't overwrite keywords

#Formatted strings: print(f'Hi {name} You are {age} years old.')

￼
Start - stop but reverse of a string !
selfish start:stop:stepover is called slicing
Immutability - Strings in python are immutable - they can’t. be changed
